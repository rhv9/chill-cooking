# chill-cooking
Relaxing cooking game. It is the final game created following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) from [CodeMonkey](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity). It is a great tutorial that showcases how to create a game from scratch in Unity. It gives you the assets so that it focuses on scriping game logic and interactions, written using good clean code.

This is the base for what I want to create. I will be adding several features to make the game more chill like tornadoes throwing the food, lightning causing fire, or aliens invading! Will come back to this soon (like every programmer says) as I am busy with another Cowboy shooting game project that I hope to finish in 2 weeks.
